# qMedia - qBittorrent Movie Library

The application shows previewable video torrents from the qBittorrent application, it serves as a video media library.

Supports playing, viewing movie details from ƒçsfd.cz and imdb.com, and deleting torrents.

The torrents table view is sortable and filterable and has a context menu.

The application contains many shortcuts and hotkeys for better UX.

qBittorrent has to be patched because torrents have to be exported to the MySQL database.
